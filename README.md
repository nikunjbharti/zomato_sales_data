**Zomato Sales Data**

In this data set, I have analyzed the Zomato sales data for Bangalore city. In this analysis, I have aimed to answer the following questions:
1)	Relationship between Online/Offline Orders and Restaurant Ratings:

  **a)	Low to Mid Ratings (1.8 - 3.7):**
  Restaurants with lower ratings (1.8 - 2.3) mostly do not accept online orders.

  In the mid-rating range (2.4 - 3.7), there is a more balanced mix, but the presence of restaurants accepting online orders increases.

  **b)	High Ratings (3.8 - 4.9):**
  Restaurants with higher ratings (3.8 - 4.9) predominantly accept online orders, with very few exceptions.

  The trend suggests that higher-rated restaurants are more likely to integrate online ordering systems, which could be contributing to their higher ratings.

  **c)	Business Implications:**
  For Lower-Rated Restaurants: Consider integrating online ordering systems to improve ratings and customer satisfaction.

  For Higher-Rated Restaurants: Maintain and enhance online ordering services to sustain high ratings.

2)	Created a word cloud to get an idea about the most famous restaurants in Bangalore city.

  **Popular food items:**
  Some of the most frequent trigrams include "chicken fried rice", "paneer butter masala", "south indian food" and "chicken biryani", indicating these are popular food choices at Quick Bites.

  **Restaurant sentiment:**
  "good food good", "food really good", and "taste really good" suggest positive customer sentiment towards the food quality. Other trigrams like "must try place" and "like home made" indicate a positive dining experience.

  **Value for money:**
  Trigrams like "good value money", "Worth every penny" and "reasonable price" suggest that customers perceive Quick Bites to offer good value for money.

4)	I have automated this code for all the restaurants.
